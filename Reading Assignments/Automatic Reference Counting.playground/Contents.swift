//How ARC Works, only applies to classes

//To make sure that instances don’t disappear while they are still needed, ARC tracks how many properties, constants, and variables are currently referring to each class instance. ARC will not deallocate an instance as long as at least one active reference to that instance still exists.

//To make this possible, whenever you assign a class instance to a property, constant, or variable, that property, constant, or variable makes a strong reference to the instance. The reference is called a “strong” reference because it keeps a firm hold on that instance, and does not allow it to be deallocated for as long as that strong reference remains.

//ARC in Action
class Person {
    let name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    var apartment: Apartment?
    deinit {
        print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
    }
}

var reference1: Person?
var reference2: Person?
var reference3: Person?

reference1 = Person(name: "John Appleseed")
reference2 = reference1
reference3 = reference1

reference1 = nil
reference2 = nil
reference3 = nil

//Strong Reference Cycles Between Class Instances

class Apartment {
    let unit: String
    init(unit: String) { self.unit = unit }
    var tenant: Person?
    deinit { print("Apartment \(unit) is being deinitialized")}
}

var john: Person?
var unit4A: Apartment?

john = Person(name: "John Appleseed")
unit4A = Apartment(unit: "4A")

john!.apartment = unit4A
unit4A!.tenant = john
//This causes a strong reference cycle

//Resolving Strong Reference Cycles Between Class Instances
//Use a weak reference when the other instance has a shorter lifetime—that is, when the other instance can be deallocated first. In the Apartment example above, it’s appropriate for an apartment to be able to have no tenant at some point in its lifetime, and so a weak reference is an appropriate way to break the reference cycle in this case. In contrast, use an unowned reference when the other instance has the same lifetime or a longer lifetime.

class Customer {
    let name: String
    var card: CreditCard?
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    deinit { print("\(name) is being deinitialized")}
}

class CreditCard {
    let number: UInt64
    unowned let customer: Customer
    init(number: UInt64, customer: Customer) {
        self.number = number
        self.customer = customer
    }
    deinit { print("Card #\(number) is being deinitialized")
    }
}

var tom: Customer?

tom = Customer(name: "John Appleseed")
tom!.card = CreditCard(number: 1234_5678_9012_3456, customer: tom!)

tom = nil

//Unowned Optional References
class Department {
    var name: String
    var courses: [Course]
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.courses = []
    }
}

class Course {
    var name: String
    unowned var department: Department
    unowned var nextCourse: Course?
    init(name: String, in department: Department) {
        self.name = name
        self.department = department
        self.nextCourse = nil
    }
}

let department = Department(name: "Horticulture")

let intro = Course(name: "Survey of Plants", in: department)
let intermediate = Course(name: "Growing Common Herbs", in: department)
let advanced = Course(name: "Caring for Tropical Plants", in: department)

intro.nextCourse = intermediate
intermediate.nextCourse = advanced
department.courses = [intro, intermediate, advanced]

//Unowned References and Implicity Unwrapped Optional Properties

//The Person and Apartment example shows a situation where two properties, both of which are allowed to be nil, have the potential to cause a strong reference cycle. This scenario is best resolved with a weak reference.

//The Customer and CreditCard example shows a situation where one property that is allowed to be nil and another property that cannot be nil have the potential to cause a strong reference cycle. This scenario is best resolved with an unowned reference.

//However, there’s a third scenario, in which both properties should always have a value, and neither property should ever be nil once initialization is complete. In this scenario, it’s useful to combine an unowned property on one class with an implicitly unwrapped optional property on the other class.

//This enables both properties to be accessed directly (without optional unwrapping) once initialization is complete, while still avoiding a reference cycle. This section shows you how to set up such a relationship.

class Country {
    let name: String
    var capitalCity: City! //Implicitly Unwrapped Optional
    init(name: String, capitalName: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.capitalCity = City(name: capitalName, country: self)
    }
}

class City {
    let name: String
    unowned let country: Country
    init(name: String, country: Country) {
        self.name = name
        self.country = country
    }
}

var country = Country(name: "Canada", capitalName: "Ottawa")
print("\(country.name)'s capital city is called \(country.capitalCity.name)")
// Prints "Canada's capital city is called Ottawa"

//Strong Reference Cycles for Closures

//A strong reference cycle can also occur if you assign a closure to a property of a class instance, and the body of that closure captures the instance. This capture might occur because the closure’s body accesses a property of the instance, such as self.someProperty, or because the closure calls a method on the instance, such as self.someMethod(). In either case, these accesses cause the closure to “capture” self, creating a strong reference cycle.

//In essence, it’s the same problem as above—two strong references are keeping each other alive. However, rather than two class instances, this time it’s a class instance and a closure that are keeping each other alive.

class HTMLElement {

    let name: String
    let text: String?

    lazy var asHTML: () -> String = {
        if let text = self.text {
            return "<\(self.name)>\(text)</\(self.name)>"
        } else {
            return "<\(self.name) />"
        }
    }

    init(name: String, text: String? = nil) {
        self.name = name
        self.text = text
    }

    deinit {
        print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
    }

}

let heading = HTMLElement(name: "h1")
let defaultText = "some default text"
heading.asHTML = {
    return "<\(heading.name)>\(heading.text ?? defaultText)</\(heading.name)>"
}
print(heading.asHTML())
// Prints "<h1>some default text</h1>"

var paragraph: HTMLElement? = HTMLElement(name: "p", text: "hello, world")
print(paragraph!.asHTML())
// Prints "<p>hello, world</p>"

paragraph = nil

//Resolving Strong Reference Cycles for Closures
//. A capture list defines the rules to use when capturing one or more reference types within the closure’s body. As with strong reference cycles between two class instances, you declare each captured reference to be a weak or unowned reference rather than a strong reference.
