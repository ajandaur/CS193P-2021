# CS193P-2021

Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI)

This repo details my progress for Stanford's CS193p for Spring 2021.

Lectures, videos & corresponding project files from Stanford can be found [here](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu).

While I did complete the course last year, I have taken a hiatus from programming to pursue other things so I thought I would re-work as well as improve some of the assignments and projects.

I am also planning to add examples and notes from the assigned readings but only for concepts that I personally am struggling with.
